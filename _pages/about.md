My name is Tang Zichen(汤子宸), an MPhil student in Data Science and Analytics(DSA) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Under the supervision of Prof. Xiaowen Chu, my research explores MLsys and Federated Learning. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Computer Science(BEng in COMP) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST) with a double major in Mathematics.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
